# Color Converter Analytics Plan

This document outlines the event tracking implemented in the color converter tools to monitor user engagement, behavior, and growth metrics.

## Implemented Event Tracking

### Page Views and Navigation

- `converter_view_[SOURCE]_to_[TARGET]` - Triggered when a converter page is loaded (DynamicConverter component)
- `converter_usage_[SOURCE]_to_[TARGET]` - Triggered when a converter component is mounted and used

### Color Conversion Actions

- `conversion_[SOURCE]_to_[TARGET]` - Tracks actual color conversion actions (debounced to avoid excessive events)
- `copy_[color]_value` - Tracks when users copy color values to clipboard
- `add_to_history_[source]_to_[target]` - Tracks when users save conversions to history

### History Management

- `history_select_[source]_to_[target]` - Tracks when users select colors from history
- `remove_from_history_[source]_to_[target]` - Tracks when users remove items from history
- `clear_color_history` - Tracks when users clear their entire color history
- `select_from_history_[source]_to_[target]` - Tracks when a color from history is selected for conversion

## Key Growth Metrics to Monitor

### User Engagement

1. **Converter Usage Metrics**
   - Most popular converter types (by page views)
   - Average time spent on converter pages
   - Conversion rate (actual conversions / page views)
   - Copy to clipboard rate (copies / conversions)

2. **Session Metrics**
   - Converters used per session
   - Return rate (% of users who come back to use converters again)
   - Cross-tool usage (users who use multiple converter types)

### User Behavior

1. **Conversion Patterns**
   - Most common color format conversions (e.g., HEX to RGB vs RGB to HSL)
   - Typical conversion workflow patterns
   - History usage rate (how often users leverage the history feature)

2. **Color Format Preferences**
   - Most popular source color formats
   - Most popular target color formats
   - Most common Pantone conversions

### Growth & Retention

1. **Acquisition Channels**
   - Which converters attract the most new users
   - SEO performance of converter pages
   - Referral sources specific to converter tools

2. **Retention Analysis**
   - Which converters have the highest return rates
   - Correlation between specific converter usage and overall site retention
   - Feature adoption rates (history, copy, etc.)

## Dashboard and Analysis Plan

1. **Daily Converter Usage Dashboard**
   - Page views by converter type
   - Conversion counts by type
   - Copy actions and history usage
   - Top source and target color formats

2. **Weekly Performance Analysis**
   - Week-over-week growth in converter usage
   - Converter popularity trends
   - Feature adoption rates
   - Color format popularity trends

3. **Monthly Strategic Analysis**
   - Conversion flow optimization recommendations
   - User journey through converter tools
   - Potential new converter types based on usage patterns
   - A/B test planning for conversion optimization

## Implementation Notes

The analytics implementation uses a standardized approach with the `useConverterTracking` hook, providing consistent tracking across all converter components. This hook offers:

1. Automatic debounced conversion tracking
2. Page view tracking
3. Helper methods for common actions (copy, history management)

Events follow the naming convention: `[action]_[source]_to_[target]` to ensure consistency and clarity in the data.

## Integration with Main Analytics

The converter analytics integrate with the main site analytics to provide a holistic view of user behavior, including:

- Cross-tool usage patterns (e.g., users who use both converters and the Pantone Color Match game)
- Overall user journey through the site
- Comprehensive retention and growth metrics
