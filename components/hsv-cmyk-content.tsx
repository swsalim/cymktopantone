      <h2>Why Convert HSV to CMYK?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>HSV color model</strong> is commonly used in <strong>digital design</strong> as
        it allows designers to adjust colors based on human perception. However, when preparing
        designs for print, <strong>CMYK</strong> is the preferred model because it represents how
        colors are physically mixed using <strong>ink</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By converting <em>HSV to CMYK</em>, designers ensure that the colors they see on screen
        <strong>accurately translate to printed materials</strong>. This is critical for
        <strong>branding, packaging, and marketing materials</strong>.

      <h2>Key Differences Between HSV and CMYK</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>HSV</strong> is designed for <strong>digital applications</strong>, allowing
        designers to adjust colors based on <em>hue, saturation, and value</em>. Itâ€™s especially
        useful for
        <strong>image editing, UI/UX design, and digital art</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CMYK</strong>, in contrast, is a <strong>subtractive color model</strong> used for
        print. It determines how <em>cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks</em> combine to create
        specific colors on paper. Converting <em>HSV to CMYK</em> is crucial to ensure{' '}
        <strong>consistent print colors</strong>.
