      <h1>HSL to CMYK Conversion</h1>
      <p>
        Understanding different color models is <strong>crucial</strong> for designers and printers
        who need precision and consistency. The <em>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)</em> model is
        commonly used in digital design, while <strong>CMYK</strong> (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and
        Black) is the standard for printing and physical media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Converting <strong>HSL to CMYK</strong> ensures that colors appear correctly when
        transitioning from digital screens to print materials. Our HSL to CMYK converter makes this
        process fast and accurate.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Convert HSL to CMYK?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>HSL color model</strong> is widely used in web and digital design for its
        intuitive way of adjusting colors. However, when preparing designs for print,{' '}
        <strong>CMYK</strong> is the preferred model since it represents how colors are physically
        mixed in ink.
      </p>
      <p>
        By converting <em>HSL to CMYK</em>, designers ensure that the colors they see on screen
        translate accurately to printed materials. This is essential for branding, marketing
        materials, and product packaging.

      <h2>Key Differences Between HSL and CMYK</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>HSL</strong> represents colors based on their hue, saturation, and lightness, making
        it ideal for digital applications. It helps designers intuitively tweak colors for UI/UX
        design, web graphics, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CMYK</strong>, on the other hand, is a subtractive color model used for print.
        Instead of adding light (as in digital screens), it determines how inks mix on paper.
        Converting <em>HSL to CMYK</em> is crucial for ensuring print colors match digital designs
        as closely as possible.
