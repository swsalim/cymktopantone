      <h1>HEX to Pantone Conversion</h1>
      <p>
        In the world of design, <strong>accurate color representation</strong> is crucial, whether
        you're working on <em>digital platforms</em> or <em>physical print materials</em>. The{' '}
        <strong>HEX color system</strong>, widely used in web design and digital graphics,
        represents colors using <strong>hexadecimal notation</strong>. While HEX codes are perfect
        for screen-based designs, they aren't ideal for{' '}
        <Link href="/convert-hex-to-cmyk">print applications</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Pantone Matching System (PMS)</strong> is the industry standard for achieving
        consistent colors in print and physical media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designers often need to bridge the gap between these systems to ensure their designs
        translate perfectly from <Link href="/convert-hex-to-rgb">screen to print</Link>. Our{' '}
        <strong>HEX to Pantone converter</strong>
        simplifies this process, allowing seamless transitions while preserving color integrity.

        HEX codes, which can display differently across various screens and devices, Pantone ensures{' '}

      <h2>Key Differences Between HEX and Pantone</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>HEX and Pantone</strong> serve different purposes in design. HEX codes are primarily
        used for <em>digital color specification</em>, making them perfect for websites, apps, and
        digital graphics. However, they lack the consistency needed for{' '}
        <Link href="/convert-hex-to-cmyk">print applications</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pantone</strong>, on the other hand, provides <em>pre-mixed spot colors</em> that
        remain consistent across all print materials. Unlike HEX codes, which rely on screen-based
        RGB rendering, Pantone colors ensure <strong>reliable color matching</strong> across
        different printers and materials.
