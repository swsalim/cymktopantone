      <h2>What are the key differences between CMYK and Hex?</h2>
      <p>
        CMYK and HEX are tailored for different applications in design. CMYK is a subtractive color
        model used in printing, where colors are created by mixing inks to subtract light. It is
        ideal for physical media and ensures accurate color reproduction in print.
      </p>
      <p>
        HEX, in contrast, is a hexadecimal representation of RGB values, designed for digital
        screens. It is compact, efficient, and widely used in web design and coding environments.
        While CMYK excels in print applications, HEX is the go-to standard for digital color
        representation.
